            <p>Matthew McConaughey's Critically Panned Movie Praised For Historical Accuracy By Expert</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Garry Adelman, a Civil War historian, praises a scene from Gary Ross’ Free State of Jones for its
                historical accuracy. Released in 2016, the historical war movie starred an ensemble cast of Matthew
                McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mahershala Ali, and Keri Russell. Inspired by the true story of Newton
                Knight, the story centered on the cynical deserter from the Confederate Army known who led a group of
                former Confederate soldiers in an uprising against the corrupt local confederate government. The story
                is based on the true life events that take place in Jones County, Mississippi during the Civil War and
                its aftermath.
                In a recent video by Insider, Adelman breaks down the historical accuracy of Free State of Jones,
                particularly touching on the famous battle of Ellesville where Knight’s group of former Confederate
                soldiers overthrew the Confederate authorities in Jones County. Adelman explained that the war
                apparatuses on display were pretty precise and the instance of women joining in on the battle is also
                accurate. Check out his full comment or watch the video below, with the relevant section starting at
                3:07:
                This battle of Ellesville sort of I would call it more of a skirmish. Here you have a substantial number
                of people in a rural county sort of rising up to secede from the south to rejoin the union and capturing
                a county seat in the meantime that’s what we’re seeing in this scene. We do have examples of women
                joining union regiments sometimes dressed as men sometimes just going into camp to be with their
                husbands, sometimes actually getting into battle as female combatants. Both sides used whatever they
                could given the time and the materials they had, sometimes it was simple as using a picket fence. So an
                overturned wagon, that must have been a great way to stop some particular bullets and if you had time to
                deal with sandbags and digging up earthworks all the better. Canons are designed to fire particular
                types of ordnance, it might be solid, it might explode in the air when it hits the ground in front of
                you, or it might shoot something like grape shot of cannister and maybe lacking all that, that’s what
                they’re showing in the movie that in this battle or skirmish, they put metal rods into their canon and
                when you blow off a canon it’ll blow out whatever is in there. At that range that they show on the
                scene, those metal rods could have been devastating to man and beast. I’m not sure if they could have
                exactly blown up the enemy ammunition chest that they’re apparently showing.</p>

            <p>How One Mission: Impossible 3 Filming Goof Nearly Made Iconic Shot Impossible Explained By VFX Artist</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>VFX artist Todd Vaziri explains how a filming goof in Mission: Impossible III made one of the movie's
                most iconic shots difficult to create. Released in 2006, the threequel followed IMF agent Ethan Hunt
                (Tom Cruise) as he was forced to confront a brutal arms dealer intent on locating the mysterious
                Rabbit's Foot. Along with Cruise, Mission: Impossible III starred Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, Billy
                Crudup, Simon Pegg, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Much like its predecessors, the movie was recognized for
                its action, and the freeway explosion that saw Hunt get thrown into a vehicle has become a particularly
                memorable sequence.
                In Corridor Crew's latest video, Vaziri, a VFX artist from Industrial Light & Magic, reveals just how
                challenging that scene was to make. He noted the factors that went into shooting it, including the
                various cars and having Cruise perform his own stunts on wires. He then explained how there were two
                cameras being used simultaneously, which created "two pieces of negative" and issues related to their
                seam. Read Vaziri's comments regarding that iconic moment in Mission: Impossible III below:
                It was very difficult to put all the stuff together and make it a cohesive camera move… So they built a
                stereo camera rig with overlap so that we can basically have two motion picture cameras going at the
                same time. So I would have two pieces of negative to work with, which is wonderful, it’s great for
                fidelity. These also have to get now seamed together and if you look carefully, Tom goes across the
                seam, and the explosion goes across the seam. You can see the dolly tracks, you can see the sandbags,
                you can see the pads and everything like that, so this was a real tricky shot to put together.
                What Makes This Mission: Impossible III Scene So Memorable?
                Bridge Stunt
                While this installment may not feature the most dangerous stunt work in the Mission: Impossible
                franchise, that sequence remains memorable for its sudden timing. After capturing Owen Davian (Hoffman),
                Hunt attempts to transfer him by ground, only for a group of criminals to begin firing at their vehicle.
                As the bridge they were crossing falls apart, and Hunt finds it difficult to secure the arms dealer, he
                decides to counter-attack, but is targeted along the way, resulting in the massive explosion.
                That action-packed scene also tracked Hunt's efforts to secure a rifle, which he nearly lost upon
                getting thrown into a parked car. In addition to pulling off Cruise's impressive stunt, Vaziri noted how
                difficult it was to include the suitcase too. In the video, he revealed that the object was rigged, and
                that there were grips on set who controlled its movement.
                For franchise fans, the plot of Mission: Impossible III brought just as much excitement as its action
                did, though the freeway scene is likely considered the movie's most iconic moment. It's interesting to
                hear how much work went into that specific stunt, and that creating the entire sequence was almost
                impossible. Given how challenging it was to accomplish, it is worth wondering what the behind-the-scenes
                looked like for other installments as well.</p>
