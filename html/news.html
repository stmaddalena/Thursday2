            <p>New Killers Of The Flower Moon Trailer Shows Leonardo DiCaprio Seeking Vengeance</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Killers Of The Flower Moon is based on David Grann’s non-fiction book of the same title, which traces the
                real-life story of the murders of Osage people across Oklahoma in the 1920s. De Niro plays DiCaprio’s
                uncle, William Hale, who this trailer shows to be extremely central in the act of taking control of the
                Osage County and its oil, which is then investigated by the FBI. The supporting cast also includes Jesse
                Plemons and Brendan Fraser.
                Having already shown at Cannes, Venice and shortly London Film Festival, it’s thankfully not too long
                until we get to feast our eyes on this fresh Scorsese – Killers Of The Flower Moon is in cinemas from 20
                October.</p>

            <p>Jodie Comer Flees A Flood In The End We Start From Teaser Trailer</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Directed by Mahalia Belo and written by Alice Birch, the film was snapped up by Signature Entertainment
                for the UK back in May.
                Set amid an environmental crisis that sees London submerged by flood waters, the feminist survival story
                focuses on a young family torn apart in the chaos. Comer plays a mother who with her new-born child
                tries to find a way home, navigating the most challenging and apocalyptic start to motherhood.
                The cast for this one includes Katherine Waterston, Joel Fry, Gina McKee, Nina Sosanya, Mark Strong and
                Benedict Cumberbatch (who is also an executive producer).
                Signature will have the film in UK cinemas in January.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Miyazaki also wrote this one, inspired by Genzaburô Yoshino's story. Here's your official synopsis: "A
                young boy named Mahito longing for his mother ventures into a world shared by the living and the dead.
                "There, death comes to an end, and life finds a new beginning. A semi-autobiographical fantasy about
                life, death and creation, in tribute to friendship, from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki."
                More than one version is in the works, including an original Japanese-language cut with English
                subtitles and an English-language dubbed version. Either way, the visuals look typically enchanting.
                The Boy And The Heron doesn't yet have a UK date set (no word on a distributor, either), but it will
                screen at the London Film Festival next month and US audiences will see it on 8 December.</p>

            <p>Stray Video Game Movie Adaptation In The Works</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Stray puts players in control of a stealthy cat who must traverse an underground city populated by robots
                and mutant bacteria with the help of a friendly drone, B-12. We liked the game — you can find our review
                here.
                "This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it," Annapurna
                Animation co-chief Robert Baird tells Entertainment Weekly. "It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a
                robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one
                human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you
                are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how
                are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we
                know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story."
                This one certainly makes sense to adapt, particularly at a time when video game movies are on a massive
                upswing thanks to the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
                And it's not the only Annapurna project to feature a veteran of Blue Skies (where Bruno worked, and
                where Nimona was originally developed). Chris Wedge, the man behind the mammoth (literally, in some
                cases) Ice Age franchise, has also set up his new movie there. FOO is reportedly about the first fish to
                ever climb out of the water and on to land – and who desperately wants to go back.</p>

            <p>Godzilla Minus One Trailer Unveils Toho’s Next Monster Epic</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, this one looks to be a stark, serious take on Godzilla, imagined once
                more as a manifestation of the nuclear terror that shook Japan at the end of World War II. The Godzilla
                Minus One trailer gives us plenty of shots of devastated cities and people terrified by the sheer
                destructive power of the marauding entity, while the synopsis places it in “the most desperate situation
                in the history of Japan”. “After the war, Japan has been reduced to zero,” it reads. “Godzilla appears
                and plunges the country into a negative state.” The film has been produced in part to mark 70 years of
                cinema’s greatest monster, and it’s set to open in Japan on 3 November.
                Toho is set to distribute Godzilla Minus One in America shortly after on 1 December – but for now, there
                doesn’t seem to be a UK release date set. Fingers crossed, we won’t be waiting long for what seems like
                another powerful take on the legendary creature. Either way, with Monarch and Godzilla X Kong to come,
                kaiju fans are about to be very well-fed.</p>

            <p>Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline Book Will Confirm Canonical Order Of MCU Events</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A new tome, titled The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline, is arriving soon to straighten
                things out – establishing the canonical chronology of every single event, reference and nod so far in
                the MCU and its attendant TV series, once and for all. “It’s the first time we’re officially laying out
                the timeline,” Marvel exec Brad Winderbaum says in a trailer for the book. “It’s incredible once it’s
                all laid out how interconnected and how seamless it is.”
                So, get ready to find out exactly when all the post-Endgame, post-Blip, post-Loki-opening-the-Multiverse
                stuff officially takes place. Obviously though, the big question is this: how many years after The
                Avengers is Spider-Man: Homecoming? That film famously announces itself as being eight years after the
                Battle Of New York – which, if you’re keeping up, would put Homecoming in 2020 and therefore some time
                in the future rather than almost immediately after Captain America: Civil War in 2016, as the story
                would demand. Even Joe Russo admitted that the time jump was “a very incorrect eight years”. So, some
                discreet ironing out is perhaps overdue. We’ll find out for sure when The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An
                Official Timeline is published on 23 October.</p>

            <p>Denis Villeneuve Teases Possible Dune: Part Three Based On Dune Messiah: ‘There Are Words On Paper’ –
                Exclusive</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From the beginning, Denis Villeneuve’s plan for Dune was to adapt Frank Herbert’s original tome as an
                epic two-part movie experience. And thankfully, given the success of Dune back in 2021, he got the green
                light to complete his adaptation with this year’s Dune: Part Two. So far, so good. But as Dune
                completists know, the story doesn’t end there. Herbert continued the story of Arrakis in a series of
                subsequent novels, before his son Brian took over to continue it even further – and if Part Two performs
                well too, Villeneuve might not be done with the sand (or the sandworms) quite yet.
                Rumours have swirled that Villeneuve could be eyeing up more Dune for the big screen – and, as he tells
                Empire in our world-exclusive Dune: Part Two cover story, that is indeed the case. “If I succeed in
                making a trilogy, that would be the dream,” he says. Part Three, then, would consist of Dune Messiah,
                Herbert’s direct follow-up to Dune. “Dune Messiah was written in reaction to the fact that people
                perceived Paul Atreides as a hero,” Villeneuve explains. “Which is not what he wanted to do. My
                adaptation [of Dune] is closer to his idea that it’s actually a warning.” If it does happen, the
                Messiah-spanning Dune: Part Three would mark the end of Villeneuve’s time on Arrakis. “After that the
                books become more… esoteric,” he says.</p>

            <p>Barbie Crosses The Billion Worldwide Box Office Mark</p>

            <p>The success story just keeps rolling along like Margot Robbie's Barbie driving (and snowmobiling,

                worldwide box office as of Sunday.
                It's only the second film this year (after The Super Mario Bros. Movie) to achieve that landmark, and
                the first directed by a woman working alone (Captain Marvel crossed the mark in 2019, but that was
                co-directed by Anna Boden with regular partner Ryan Fleck.) Plus, while it took Mario four weeks to hit
                the mark, Barbie did it in three.</p>

            <p>Across The Spider-Verse Nearly Included A Spider-Man Toy Being Held By A Giant Human Hand</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, there was a particular thrill in seeing so many Spider-people share
                a single frame – Miles Morales, next to Spider-Gwen, joined by Peter B. Parker, and Spider-Man Noir, and
                Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker. Cut to 2023, and sequel Across The Spider-Verse blows that out of the
                water. As Miles Morales heads out of his own universe and into several others, he eventually finds
                himself – MILD SPOILERS – in Nueva York, where super-serious Spidey Miguel O’Hara has assembled a vast
                squad of Spider-people in his HQ, Spider Society. It’s a sequence that’s begging to be paused once the
                film hits home entertainment, every corner of the screen crammed with specific Spider-pals.
                “It we take the sequence as a whole, there are over 600 different spiders,” Justin K. Thompson, one of
                Across The Spider-Verse’s three directors, tells Empire in the new issue. “It’s somewhere in the
                neighborhood of 630-ish.” As for specifically-named Spider-people with specific designs, that amounts to
                around 150 – will all kinds of wild variants, from the web-spitting Spider-Cat, to a Spider-fied T. rex.
                “From the beginning, I was like, ‘Can we have Peter Parkedcar?’,” says Thompson. “’Can he look like a
                Hanna Barbera cartoon?’” The answer, evidently, proved to be, ‘Yes’.</p>

            <p>Oppenheimer Receives R-Rating In The US, Christopher Nolan’s First In Two Decades</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Not long now until the most potentially divisive cinematic release date in history – yes, in just a few
                weeks, both Christopher Nolan’s thriller Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s pastel-tastic Barbie will be
                hitting the big screen. The former is Nolan’s 12th feature film – and, as revealed at the end of a new
                American TV spot promoting the J. Robert Oppenheimer pic, it will be his first one to be rated R in the
                US in two decades, the last being his 2002 crime drama, Insomnia.
                Though plenty of Nolan’s films since Insomnia have featured some pretty dark themes – a method of
                time-travel that could mean the end of the world, an intense recreation of the events of Dunkirk, his
                moody, violent Batman trilogy – and definitely aren’t the most kid-friendly material, all have received
                a 12 rating here in the UK, aka. a PG-13 in the US. This newly confirmed R-rating in the States (the
                approximate UK equivalent of a 15) implies Nolan is stepping that darkness up a gear – hardly
                surprising, given Oppenheimer is all about the development and detonation of the world’s first atomic
                bomb. The UK rating is yet to be confirmed.
                Cillian Murphy, frequent Nolan collaborator, takes the lead in Oppenheimer as the titular physicist,
                with an epic supporting cast including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Benny
                Safdie, and many more. Prepare to be blown away – hopefully not literally, though it was shot in IMAX –
                when Oppenheimer lands in UK cinemas on 21 July.</p>
